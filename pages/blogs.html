        Debugging Published 7 months ago Definition: Debugging is the process of
        detecting and removing existing and potential errors (also called
        'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or
        crash. In the career of software development you are likely to face bugs
        as explained in the definition of debugging and in this article i am
        going to walk you through all kinds of programming bugs and tools and
        techniques used to solve those kinds of programming bugs. Types of Bugs
        1. Syntax Errors. Just like human languages, computer languages have
        grammar rules. But while humans are able to communicate with
        less-than-perfect grammar, computers can’t ignore mistakes, i.e. syntax
        errors. For example, let’s say the correct syntax for printing something
        is console.log(‘Hello my name is Bruno’), and we accidentally forget one
        of the parentheses while coding. A syntax error will happen, and this
        will stop the program from running. As your proficiency with programming
        language increases, you will make syntax errors less frequently. The
        easiest way to prevent them from causing you problems is to be aware of
        them early. Many text editors or IDEs will come with the ability to warn
        you about syntax errors at the time of writing. 2. Logic Errors. Logic
        errors can be the hardest to track down. Everything looks like it is
        working; you have just programmed the computer to do the wrong thing.
        Technically the program is correct, but the results won’t be what you
        expected. If you didn’t check the requirements beforehand and wrote code
        to return the oldest user in your system when you needed the newest, you
        would have a logic error. A famous example happened in 1999 when NASA
        lost a spacecraft due to miscalculations between English and American
        units. The software was coded one way but needed to work another. When
        writing your tests, show them to the product manager or product owner to
        confirm that the logic you’re about to write is correct. In the example
        above, someone closer to the business would have spotted that you aren’t
        mentioning the fact it is the newest user that is required. 3.
        Compilation Errors. Some programming languages require a compilation
        step. Compilation is where your high-level language converts into a
        lower-level language that the computer can understand better. A
        compilation or compile-time error happens when the compiler doesn’t know
        how to turn your code into the lower-level code. In our syntax error
        example, if we were compiling print('hello', the compiler would stop and
        tell us it doesn’t know how to convert this into a lower-level language
        because it expected a ) after the '. If there is a compile-time error in
        your software, you won’t be able to get it tested or launched. Like
        syntax errors, you will get better at avoiding these with time, but in
        general, the best thing you can do is get early feedback when it
        happens. Compilation happens across all files of your project at the
        same time. If you’ve made lots of changes and see lots of compiler
        warnings or errors, it can be very daunting. By running the compiler
        often, you will get the feedback you need sooner, and you will more
        easily know where to address the issues. These are the main bugs that
        most programmers meet, Other bugs include Runtime, Arithmetic,
        resource,interface errors/bugs. Process to help you debug such errors or
        bugs mentioned above. The debugging process usually consists of the
        following: examine the error symptoms, identify the cause, and finally
        fix the error. This process may be quite difficult and require a large
        amount of work, because of the following reasons: The symptoms may not
        give clear indications about the cause. In particular, the cause and the
        symptom may be remote, either in space (i.e., in the program code), or
        in time (i.e., during the execution of the program), or both. Defensive
        programming can help reduce the distance between the cause and the
        effect of an error. Symptoms may be difficult to reproduce. Replay is
        needed to better understand the problem. Being able to reproduce the
        same program execution is a standard obstacle in debugging concurrent
        programs. An error may show up only in one particular interleaving of
        statements from the parallel threads, and it may be almost impossible to
        reproduce that same, exact interleaving. Errors may be correlated.
        Therefore, symptoms may change during debugging, after fixing some of
        the errors. The new symptoms need to be re-examined. The good part is
        that the same error may have multiple symptoms; in that case, fixing the
        error will eliminate all of them. Fixing an error may introduce new
        errors. Statistics indicate that in many cases fixing a bug introduces a
        new one! This is the result of trying to do quick hacks to fix the
        error, without understanding the overall design and the invariants that
        the program is supposed to maintain. Once again, a clean design and
        careful thinking can avoid many of these cases. DEBUGGING STRATEGIES
        Although there is no precise procedure for fixing all bugs, there are a
        number of useful strategies that can reduce the debugging effort. A
        significant part (if not all) of this process is spent localizing the
        error, that is, figuring out the cause from its symptoms. Below are
        several useful strategies to help with this. Keep in mind that different
        techniques are better suited in different cases; there is no clear best
        method. It is good to have knowledge and experience with all of these
        approaches. Sometimes, a combination of one or more of these approaches
        will lead you to the error. Incremental and bottom-up program
        development. One of the most effective ways to localize errors is to
        develop the program incrementally, and test it often, after adding each
        piece of code. It is highly likely that if there is an error, it occurs
        in the last piece of code that you wrote. With incremental program
        development, the last portion of code is small; the search for bugs is
        therefore limited to small code fragments. An added benefit is that
        small code increments will likely lead to few errors, so the programmer
        is not overwhelmed with long lists of errors. Bottom-up development
        maximizes the benefits of incremental development. With bottom-up
        development, once a piece of code has been successfully tested, its
        behavior won't change when more code is incrementally added later.
        Existing code doesn't rely on the new parts being added, so if an error
        occurs, it must be in the newly added code (unless the old parts weren't
        tested well enough). Instrument program to log information. Typically,
        print statements are inserted. Although the printed information is
        effective in some cases, it can also become difficult to inspect when
        the volume of logged information becomes huge. In those cases, automated
        scripts may be needed to sift through the data and report the relevant
        parts in a more compact format. Visualization tools can also help
        understand the printed data. For instance, to debug a program that
        manipulates graphs, it may be useful to use a graph visualization tool
        (such as ATT's graphviz) and print information in the appropriate format
        (.dot files for graphviz). Instrument program with assertions.
        Assertions check if the program indeed maintains the properties or
        invariants that your code relies on. Because the program stops as soon
        as an assertion fails, it's likely that the point where the program
        stops is much closer to the cause, and is a good indicator of what the
        problem is. An example of assertion checking is the repOK() function
        that verifies if the representation invariant holds at function
        boundaries. Note that checking invariants or conditions is the basis of
        defensive programming. The difference is that the number of checks is
        usually increased during debugging for those parts of the program that
        are suspected to contain errors. Use debuggers. If a debugger is
        available, it can replace the manual instrumentation using console.logs
        if using javascript statements or assertions. Setting breakpoints in the
        program, stepping into and over functions, watching program expressions,
        and inspecting the memory contents at selected points during the
        execution will give all the needed run-time information without
        generating large, hard-to-read log files. Backtracking. One option is to
        start from the point where the problem occurred and go back through the
        code to see how that might have happened. Binary search. The
        backtracking approach will fail if the error is far from the symptom. A
        better approach is to explore the code using a divide-and-conquer
        approach, to quickly pin down the bug. For example, starting from a
        large piece of code, place a check halfway through the code. If the
        error doesn't show up at that point, it means the bug occurs in the
        second half; otherwise, it is in the first half. Thus, the code that
        needs inspection has been reduced to half. Repeating the process a few
        times will quickly lead to the actual problem. Problem simplification. A
        similar approach is to gradually eliminate portions of the code that are
        not relevant to the bug. For instance, if a function fun f() =
        (g();h();k()) yields an error, try eliminating the calls to g, h, and k
        successively (by commenting them out), to determine which is the
        erroneous one. Then simplify the code in the body of the buggy function,
        and so on. Continuing this process, the code gets simpler and simpler.
        The bug will eventually become evident. A similar technique can be
        applied to simplify data rather than code. If the size of the input data
        is too large, repeatedly cut parts of it and check if the bug is still
        present. When the data set is small enough, the cause may be easier to
        understand. A scientific method: form hypotheses. A related approach is
        as follows: inspect the test case results; form a hypothesis that is
        consistent with the observed data; and then design and run a simple test
        to refute the hypothesis. If the hypothesis has been refuted, derive
        another hypothesis and continue the process. In some sense, this is also
        a simplification process: it reduces the number of possible hypotheses
        at each step. But unlike the above simplification techniques, which are
        mostly mechanical, this process is driven by active thinking about an
        explanation. A good approach is to try to come with the simplest
        hypotheses and the simplest corresponding test cases. Consider, for
        example, a function palindrome(s:string):bool, and suppose that
        palindrome("able was I were I saw elba") returns an incorrect value of
        false. Here are several possible hypotheses for this failure. Maybe
        palindrome fails for inputs with spaces (test " "); maybe it fails for
        programs with upper case letters (try "I"); maybe it fails for inputs of
        odd length greater than one (try "ere"), and so on. Forming and testing
        these hypotheses one after another can lead the programmer to the source
        of the problem. Bug clustering. If a large number of errors are being
        reported, it is useful to group them into classes of related bugs (or
        similar bugs), and examine only one bug from each class. The intuition
        is that bugs from each class have the same cause (or a similar cause).
        Therefore, fixing a bug will automatically fix all the other bugs from
        the same class (or will make it obvious how to fix them).
        Error-detection tools. Such tools can help programmers quickly identify
        violations of certain classes of errors. For instance, tools that check
        safety properties can verify that file accesses in a program obey the
        open-read/write-close file sequence; that the code correctly manipulates
        locks; or that the program always accesses valid memory. Such tools are
        either dynamic (they instrument the program to find errors at run-time),
        or use static analysis (look for errors at compile-time). For instance,
        Purify is a popular dynamic tool that instruments programs to identify
        memory errors, such as invalid accesses or memory leaks. Examples when
        using javascript and VScode as your IDE. i would suggest vs code
        extension as ESlint which will help you find errors and Bugs without
        even realising it. Eslint is going to help you realise the error within
        a statement most especially syntax errors and Typos, as shown below;
        BEST PRACTICES TO AVOID FUTURE BUGS. Leverage the Hints from the IDE
        This one should be obvious to most programmers, but the reality is that
        the tools we use are a bit smarter than what we give them credit for.
        It’s easy to miss these hints. They are sometimes buried in build logs,
        drowned in a sea of flags, visually too subtle to attract our
        much-needed attention. Listen to your Integrated Development Environment
        (IDE)—it is telling you something. One of the most obvious signs that
        something is up with your code is when the IDE tells you that you are
        not using a variable you introduced earlier in your code. You had some
        intent for this variable, but that intent got lost while working on some
        other aspect. There is certainly a bug lurking there. Another useful
        alert is when the IDE detects that there is a logical path for a
        NullPointerException. Maybe the most common case is well taken care of,
        but there seems to be a road less-travelled to this ubiquitous
        exception. The activity of writing code forces you to concentrate on the
        text you are typing while keeping a stack of other concerns in mind.
        This cognitive load is already heavy; I like to reduce it by removing
        ambiguities. The IDE will tell you when you are using the same variable
        name for an instance variable and a local variable. I don’t need to risk
        being confused about which one I am manipulating. I’ll follow my digital
        assistant’s advice and rename the local variable in question. Break up
        Your Content The brain can only keep so much information. And each
        coding window only shows you about 50 lines. When the code grows, so
        does the likelihood of bugs, just from not remembering details
        implemented a few invisible lines away. One simple technique to avoid
        such troubles is to break up the code. Keep the methods short. Ideally,
        a well-focused class shouldn’t have more than 200 lines. It’s not always
        possible, but where it is, you can avoid bugs when each class has only
        one responsibility. The class’ code itself is easy to review, and its
        function is easy to remember in other contexts. If you just wrote a
        large body of code in one class, it’s time to break it up into smaller
        pieces. This is nothing new. When the metric of cyclomatic complexity
        was developed in 1976, its first applications tried to limit the
        complexity of each module, splitting them into smaller modules. These
        modules became easier to write, and easier to test, too. If the most
        likely place for defects is where complexity lies, reducing complexity
        automatically reduces the rate of defects. It’s not just the height of
        your screen that matters when having “too much to code” might be “too
        much to cope.” The width matters, too. This is actually a classic source
        of bugs: a line goes beyond what’s visible without scrolling, meaning
        it’s not being looked at as often as other lines. Code reviewed less is
        more likely to be incorrect. Long lines are also bug candidates when
        overly confident IDEs autofill their content over the developer’s
        watchful eyes. The simple solution is to break up these long lines, for
        example, inserting carriage returns when they go over 120 characters.
        The IDE will often show you this limit graphically. Don’t Leave Your
        Code to Chance. I have seen many cases where two (or more) classes have
        the exact same name. They have different package names, but package
        names are hidden away at the very beginning of each class that uses
        another class. It’s a good idea to give classes unique names across your
        code base. This will make sure there is no ambiguity around which one a
        developer is using. Murphy’s law is not your friend—you will inevitably
        pick the wrong one otherwise. The behavior of HashMaps may also be a
        source of hard-to-troubleshoot bugs. The Java Virtual Machine tends to
        optimize the behavior of HashMaps when the application load grows. What
        this means for developers is that you will observe one behavior during
        development, and a different behavior in production. To avoid this kind
        of head-scratching riddle, I have learned to use LinkedHashMaps even
        when not needed as they will always return entries in a consistent
        manner. This is a trick to use wisely: the performance cost of using
        LinkedHashMaps should be weighed against the risk of having to solve a
        problem that only happens in production. Reuse Existing Code At the end
        of the day, there is so much to keep track of, just writing code is
        doomed to produce bugs. The simplest way to avoid writing bugs is not
        write any code at all, and leverage some other battle-tested component
        instead. Reusing code is the ultimate simplification technique, but I am
        not just talking about integrating other people’s work into your own
        software. The code you already have is the result of many refactorings.
        It has real-world experience you are missing (or that you forgot). Use
        the code you already have as your template. If the quality of your
        template is not what you need, refactor this code, then reuse it. There
        shouldn’t be in your program “two best patterns” to do the same thing.
        As I implement a new feature, I typically look at similar code doing
        similar things: how classes, methods, and variables are (meaningfully)
        named, which properties and behaviors are exposed, how objects interact
        with each other, etc. In all the bodies of code I have maintained for
        several years, I have found that consistency is the easiest constraint
        to follow, to teach, and the one that brings the most benefits in terms
        of overall quality. Code Refactoring. Code refactoring is a process used
        in the DevOps software development approach that involves editing and
        cleaning up previously written software code without changing the
        function of the code at all. The basic purpose of code refactoring is to
        make the code more efficient and maintainable. This is key in reducing
        technical cost since it’s much better to clean up the code now than pay
        for costly errors later. Code refactoring, which improves readability,
        makes the QA and debugging process go much more smoothly. And while it
        doesn’t remove bugs, it can certainly help prevent them in the future.
        And this is why there is a need for routine code refactoring. Code
        refactoring is important if you want to avoid the dreaded code rot. Code
        rot results from duplicate code, myriad patches, bad classifications,
        and other programming discrepancies. Having a revolving door of
        different developers writing in their own styles can also contribute to
        code rot, as there is no cohesion to the overall coding script. Best
        practices for code refactoring. There are several best practices and
        recommendations regarding code refactoring. One of the smartest ways to
        approach it is to apply the Agile method and do it one step at a time,
        followed by testing. This is why so many developers utilizing Agile
        methodology are big proponents of code refactoring. Breaking down the
        refactoring process into manageable chunks and performing timely testing
        before moving on to other updates always results in a higher quality
        application and a better overall development experience. Here are a few
        other best practices: Refactor first before adding any new features It
        is always a good idea to perform refactoring whenever you’re asked to
        add new features or updates to an existing solution. Yes, it will take
        longer to finish the project, but it will also reduce the amount of
        technical debt you or the product owner will have to deal with in the
        future. Plan your refactoring project and timeline carefully One of the
        hardest parts of code refactoring is finding the time to do it properly.
        Think about your overall goal. Do you just want to change the variable
        names to improve readability? Or do you want to do a full-on cleanup?
        What are the best ways for you to optimize the code within a reasonable
        timeframe? The most important outcome of refactoring is that not only is
        the code cleaner but that it actually works. And remember, it’s going to
        take longer than you think, so plan accordingly and give yourself a
        little extra cushion of time. Test often The last thing you want to do
        when refactoring is mess something up in the process and create bugs or
        problems that affect the functionality of the product. This is why
        testing throughout the refactoring process is imperative. Make sure you
        have proper tests in place before starting any refactoring project. Get
        your QA team involved It’s always a good idea to get your QA and testing
        team involved in the refactoring process. Whenever you’re making changes
        to existing code, even as a clean-up project, it can affect testing
        outcomes. Changes in classification done during refactoring can cause
        old tests to fail. In addition, new tests may have to be created for
        outdated legacy software systems. Both in-depth and regression testing
        should be performed as part of a refactoring effort. This will ensure
        that the functionality of the solution was not affected in any way.
        Development teams using the Agile method for both programming and
        testing will most likely already be on the same page involving
        refactoring. Focus on progress, not perfection All code eventually
        becomes the dreaded legacy code. Accept the fact that you will never be
        100 percent satisfied. The code you’re currently refactoring will become
        stale and outdated in the near future and will require refactoring all
        over again. You have to start thinking about refactoring as an ongoing
        maintenance project. Just like you have to clean and organize your home
        throughout the week, you will need to clean and organize your code on
        many different occasions. Try refactoring automation As with most
        processes, the more it can be automated, the easier and faster
        refactoring becomes. Automating some or all of the refactoring processes
        is becoming more and more popular with developers. There are many
        shortcuts and tools to make refactoring less painful. A lot of them can
        be learned by reading Martin Fowler’s book. Two IDEs (Integrated
        Development Environments) that have built-in automated refactoring
        support are Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. Look for more refactoring
        automation in other IDEs in the near future as refactoring shortcuts
        continue to be a major concern for the development community. Code
        Refactoring in Action; This kind of code can be refactored and be
        changed to something like this and still produces the same output; This
        will help in reading and understanding your code more easily and also
        avoid many lines and messy code. Thanks for Reading 💜

      <h2>Information and Technology</h2>
      <p>
        Information and Technology Published 7 months ago According to wikipedia
        Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve,
        transmit, and manipulate data[1] or information. IT is typically used
        within the context of business operations as opposed to personal or
        entertainment technologies. Basically IT in simple words is a field that
        contains my computer knowledge and understanding including network ,
        softwares and many more in general. THE PROS AND CONS OF INFORMATION AND
        TECHNOLOGY. In universities IT is considered as a group of computer
        based majors and that involves; Software engineering which is the making
        of computer software programmes in simple words, The next major in IT is
        Networking which is the interaction with networks and setting up things
        like LAN,WAN and basically things that make the connectivity to the
        internet works, Digging deep into IT majors also involves communication
        and network systems , Computer data scientists and many more… THE PROS.
        Be better at your job, For anyone who already has a job or a career in a
        particular area, IT courses can be an outstanding way to get a greater
        understanding of the technological aspects of the job. A diploma in IT
        is highly valued in many careers, especially those with a financial or
        creative focus. Employees who complete a course in computer science, or
        similar areas, give themselves a boost on their job performance
        instantly. Earn more money, Having a solid base in a practical area, or
        upskilling if you already have a set of expertise, is the right way to
        go about starting on a good salary and receiving a raise. As information
        technology courses are highly prized in modern businesses, graduates get
        a leg up on the competition with these transferable skills. Make more
        connections, One of the biggest benefits of completing IT courses that
        focus on practical skills and employability, is that students meet
        like-minded classmates and make new connections. Networking is a crucial
        part of finding employment in the professional sphere, and interacting
        with others in a learning space will provide insight and friendships
        that would not be possible otherwise. Expand your knowledge , On a more
        abstract level, keeping the mind active will have noticeable benefits
        for anyone who has been out of schooling for a while. By putting
        themselves in unfamiliar situations and completing new learning
        challenges, students of these information technology courses often find
        a renewed enthusiasm for education, as well as a heightened ability to
        adapt and expand their minds to fresh skill sets. Modernize your skills,
        Staying relevant in a constantly changing workforce is no easy task, and
        IT courses are currently among the most consistently expanding areas of
        demand for employees. Updating a current skill set, or adding extra
        accomplishments to an existing list, is a sure-fire way to establish
        mastery and experience in many aspects of your business. THE CONS
        Unemployment and lack of job security, implementing the information
        systems can save a great deal of time during the completion of tasks and
        some labor mechanic works. Most paperwork can be processed immediately,
        financial transactions are automatically calculated, etc. As technology
        improves, tasks that were formerly performed by human employees are now
        carried out by computer systems. For example, automated telephone
        answering systems have replaced live receptionists in many organizations
        or online and personal assistants can be good examples also. Industry
        experts believe that the internet has made job security a big issue as
        technology keeps on changing with each day. This means that one has to
        be in a constant learning mode, if he or she wishes for their job to be
        secure. Dominant culture, while information technology may have made the
        world a global village, it has also contributed to one culture
        dominating another weaker one. For example it is now argued that the US
        influences how most young teenagers all over the world now act, dress
        and behave. Languages too have become overshadowed, with English
        becoming the primary mode of communication for business and everything
        else. Security issues, thieves and hackers get access to identities and
        corporate saboteurs target sensitive company data. Such data can include
        vendor information, bank records, intellectual property and personal
        data on company management. The hackers distribute the information over
        the Internet, sell it to rival companies or use it to damage the
        company’s image. For example, several retail chains were targeted
        recently by hackers who stole customer information from their
        information systems and distributed Social Security numbers and credit
        card data over the Internet. Implementation expenses, to integrate the
        information system it requires a pretty good amount of cost in the case
        of software, hardware and people. Software, hardware and some other
        services should be rented, bought and supported. Employees need to be
        trained with unfamiliar information technology and software. In
        conclusion, despite the cons of IT (information and communication
        Technology) , In general IT is among the best opportunities to major
        into due to its high increasing rate in employment which can be good for
        someone`s future. Thanks for Reading 💜

        My journey through ATLP <br />
        ATLP Andela Technical Leadership program is a project hosted by Andela
        Rwanda to help train motivated software engineers to become job ready
        and acquire technical skills within a short period of time. WHY I JOINED
        ANDELA Andela felt like a headstart to my career goals as a software
        engineer. I needed to find a place where I could put my skills in
        programming to use and test, and that is when andela came in. By joining
        Andela, a trainee is able to acquire advanced skills and technologies
        like NODE JS , REACT , MONGODB , PostGres , GITHUB and GIT, You also get
        to meet your trainers who are not just trainers but also like brothers.
        Andela is not only a team but also an expanding family. WHAT I’M GETTING
        FROM ANDELA There are many skills that Andela provides, not only working
        with computers but also interacting with the world and its people. By
        saying that I mean the world class technical skills taught by the best
        pals in Andela. As a team, we work remotely, Which is also another skill
        that we must be familiar with because the world is changing so fast. In
        fact I think people will no longer go to work at the office but rather
        stay at home and work from there. To the part of programming, we get to
        work with a technology that allows us to share codes and update codes as
        if we are working in the same room. Github is the technology that we use
        and thanks to our facilitators that taught us how to interact with it.
        WHERE I SEE MYSELF IN THE FUTURE After completing the wonderful 9 months
        with andela, I see myself in a world of programming. Also ready to start
        fulfilling my dreams of working with tech companies. Andela helps us
        become differentiated from other software engineers around the globe,
        and how is that!; We acquired iconic skills which included working
        remotely also the technical skills that we acquire which help us to keep
        a good attitude with our workmates and more about problem solving when
        working in teams. We also learn public speaking skills that help you to
        know how to sell your ideas , defend your projects and talk among large
        numbers. This will help me start working with many people on big
        projects and outstanding everyone else on the job market. All in all I
        would recommend Rwandan programmers out there globally to join Andela as
        soon as possible. Best regards.
